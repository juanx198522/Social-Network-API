### Description
In this project we build an API for a social network web application that allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage their friend lists. The application is powered by Express.js for routing, MongoDB for data storage and Mongoose for object-document mapping. This API is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently.

### User Story
As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The server is started, and Mongoose models are synced with the MongoDB database.
- API routes are available for users and thoughts, supporting GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations.
- Users can view data for users and thoughts in formatted JSON.
- Users can create, update, and delete users and thoughts.
- Users can create and delete reactions to thoughts.
- Users can add and remove friends from their friend lists.
